PowerShell module providing building blocks for a simple, scalable CLI menu for your tools and scripts.

Are you spending too much time on a UI for your script? Then end up spending an even longer amount of time debugging it? 
Then this is the module for you!

With CLI-Menu, you can now focus on building the logic you want, with a navigation interface inspired by the menu available on HPE ProCurve switches. 

Navigation:
- Arrow keys
- Jump to item with number keys (coming soon)

Special keys are fully customisable, but some suggested uses:
- Spacebar to bring up description/definition of highlighted item
- Esc to backtrack

## Disclaimer
This is my first PowerShell module and public GitHub project. I probably won't do everything right, and the code won't be as streamlined as it could be, but know that I'm trying my best and I hope you find this as useful as I do.
